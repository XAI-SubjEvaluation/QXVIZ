# SNIPPET
The repo is to open source our framework, which is proposed for subjective evaluation of visually explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods.  And this repo will continuously update our related works and collected data.

## Website
The website of our framework: http://qxviz.ai/

We wrote a technical report in [Technical Description of the Website](https://github.com/XAI-SubjEvaluation/QXVIZ/blob/main/Technical%20Description%20of%20the%20Website.pdf). You can follow the .pdf file and create your own subjective evaluation survey for different XAI methods.

## Introduction
We introduce a generic and comprehensive framework for subjective evaluation in visual explanations, focusing on finding human-friendly explanations. Meanwhile, we aim to build a dataset that conforms to human perception as a benchmark for future human-comprehensible XAI algorithms.
